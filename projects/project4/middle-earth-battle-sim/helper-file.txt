Hobbiton BrushhandHobbiton brush webkit downloaded

Small popup element will give the user the option to start

we  will start the tale  with the original alerts as fade away lines in hobbiton font in a book

Then we will show the first option, age as 4 vertical images, hovering would have a sound

Backround will change depending on the selection from the user

The first background should be one of paper from a book 

1st option is Age we should present this as 4 images with something representative of the age,

Two images each, the default state should be the night image with a corresponding evil race and low visibility

Once hovered on, the image should change to the day one with the good side race fully visible

1. Elves/dwarves, balrog related>  the two trees should also be visible
2. Dunedain, orc related > the moon and the sun should be visible
3. Hobbits related, goblins related > during night and day the ring should be visible night Sauron eye
	day
4. Lesser men, at day gondorian soldiers, 


The second option will then come location:
same as before the images will change 

1. South [Gondor, Mordor, Rohan
2.  North [Arnor, Angmar]   
3. West [Eriador,Blue Mntns, Forlindon]
4. East [Mirkwood, Erebor, Misty Mntns]

The third option will be the valar 

1.Manwë (King of arda)
2.Melkor (Morgoth)
3.Aulë (Dwarves)
4.Varda (stars)
5.Oromë (Hunter)
6.Námo (Mandos)
7.Estë
8.Lórien

Depending on the selection of the user will will create a background image:

for example if the first age is selected we will use the night background with reduced opacity
that image should the main races of the age to the left hand side
then in top of that we will add a location image, also with reduced opacity of the location, for example south, will have minas tirith and mordor, thii should be a background location to the middle left hand side of the page, and a right-hand side corner 
finaly the image of the selected valar will go to the top right corner looking at the middle of the page 

that background will be the main place to show the history

we will add the simulation results here, 

Finally there should be a menu to start again, that shows the scores as well
