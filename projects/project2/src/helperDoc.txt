id generator:

this one will take the input from the previous function

which should be a reduced array without duplicates

measure the array and repeat the following process

chec


until the array length is duplicated the script should take the index of the current element, substract 1 and write an element (that contains the current index of the current element) to the resulting index number
The original element must not be deleted we are just adding one element to the left of each element in the array


Generate two ASCII symbols randomly between 33 and 63
store them in an array

pop the last character and assign it to the splice function as the 3rd parameter (the data to add)

generate a random number that is within the length of the current randomword array

pass that number to the splice function as the index to add

/////////////////////


the dataValidator function should get an element and then validate what it is composed of:
should return:

Word for only letters 
Identifier for only numbers
dirty for mixed content 

//////////////////////////////



the function: dataValidator(element);

will return either 'word' , 'id' or 'dirty'

resultingarray is an empty array and should be used as accumulator of the the reduce function

I want to use the .reduce method of array to check each element of an array by passing it to the dataValidator function, and if the element is clean, it and the element immediately before it should be added to the resultingarray
It then should return the resulting array


///////////////////////////


the dataValidator function receives an element and then validate what it is composed of and returns:

Word for only letters 
Identifier for only numbers
dirty for mixed content 

I want to use the dataValidator function to:
if it is a word:
	we check if it is shorter or equal to 3 letters and if it is we return true
	(no need to check further if there is at least 1 short word)

if it is a number:
	we do nothing and move to the next element
if it is dirty we should return 'error mixed content'


/////////////////////////////////

We want to use the .reduce method, to add only the words which length is higher than 3

//////////////////////////////


optional functions that didn't make it:

1. We don't really like odd numbers in this house, we follow the rule of 2, remove any word element which number identifier is an odd number

	> "Two there should be; no more, no less. One to embody power, the other to crave it." *(Sheev Palpatine)*

1. We really mean it, remove any word which identifier includes at least an odd number.
